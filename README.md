# capstone-b3nharris
Capstone project for b3nharris for ds4owd-001

**Is the WASH sector beating the economic curve?**

Concept for the project taken from the blog: https://www.ircwash.org/blog/%E2%80%9Ci-am-bored-work%E2%80%9D-washs-mid-life-crisis

- Global comparison on progress on poverty (WB data) and WASH (JMP households)
	- Water and Sanitation seperately
- Country-level analysis to identify positive outliers (countries making faster progress on WASH than poverty)
- Analysis on aid flows (OECD) to see if those countries making the best progress are also those receiving most aid per capita (overall and to the WASH sector)
