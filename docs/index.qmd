Capstone project for b3nharris for ds4owd-001

## Is the WASH sector beating the economic curve?

**Concept for the project taken from the blog:** [`https://www.ircwash.org/blog/%E2%80%9Ci-am-bored-work%E2%80%9D-washs-mid-life-crisis`](https://www.ircwash.org/blog/%E2%80%9Ci-am-bored-work%E2%80%9D-washs-mid-life-crisis)

-   Global comparison on progress on poverty (WB data) and WASH (JMP households)
    -   Water and Sanitation seperately
-   Country-level analysis to identify positive outliers (countries making faster progress on WASH than poverty)
-   Analysis on aid flows (OECD) to see if those countries making the best progress are also those receiving most aid per capita (overall and to the WASH sector)
